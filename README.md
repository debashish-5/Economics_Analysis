# üåç Country Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Country Data Analysis** project ‚Äî a complete end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) task built using Python. This project demonstrates data cleaning, feature exploration, visualization, and statistical insight extraction from real-world country-level data.

This is part of my Data Science journey where I applied core concepts of data preprocessing, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to uncover meaningful patterns from global datasets.

## üìÅ Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `country.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with full data analysis code and visualizations. |
| `Country_Data_Analysis.csv` | Primary dataset containing country-level statistics. |
| `data_updates.csv` | Updated/cleaned or additional version of the dataset used in some parts of the analysis. |

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- Load and understand a real-world dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize patterns and relationships between features
- Draw insights that can support further modeling or decision-making

## üîç Topics Covered

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Checking data types and fixing them
- Handling missing values using strategies like mean/median imputation
- Identifying and removing duplicate records
- Detecting outliers using statistical methods

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Summary statistics using Pandas
- Correlation matrix and heatmaps
- Distribution plots for numerical features
- Count plots and bar graphs for categorical features

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, bar charts
- Advanced plots using **Seaborn** (pairplot, heatmap, etc.)
- Comparison of countries based on GDP, population, literacy rate, and more

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
- Creating new columns from existing ones (e.g., GDP per capita)
- Grouping and aggregating data for comparative analysis

### 5. **Insights Extraction**
- Top and bottom-ranked countries on various metrics
- Correlation between GDP and literacy/population/health
- Identifying trends and patterns for future predictions
